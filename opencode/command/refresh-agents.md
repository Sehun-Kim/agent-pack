description: Regenerate ~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md (agent-pack)
---

Run the refresh script to regenerate the OpenCode global entrypoint file.

If you installed agent-pack to the default location:

```bash
bash ~/agent-pack/scripts/refresh-agents.sh
```

If your repo lives elsewhere, run the script from that path:

```bash
bash /path/to/agent-pack/scripts/refresh-agents.sh
```
